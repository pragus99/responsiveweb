Creating this complete bootstrap responsive website Using Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/JS
I'm using bootstrap to glorify the website and make it responsive. I also add some custom style to make it more attractive. The navigation menu, website title, and different sections where I have feature section, pricing section, teamÂ 
member section and so on.
I'm also using font awesome website to use free icons and used images from pexels.com.
I create this website for desktop and then make it responsive for mobile. You can see this website is completely responsive for mobile and tablet devices.
